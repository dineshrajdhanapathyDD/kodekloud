Questions:
The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to create few jobs in Kubernetes cluster. They might come up with some real scripts/commands to use, but for now they are preparing the templates and testing the jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:


1.Create a job (countdown-devops).

2.The spec template should be named as (countdown-devops) (under metadata), and the container should be named as (container-countdown-devops)

3.Use image (debian) with (latest) tag only and remember to mention tag i.e (debian:latest), and restart policy should be (Never).

4. Use command (sleep 5)

Note: The (kubectl) utility on (jump_host) has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


Solution:  
1. At first  kubectl  utility configure and working from jump server, run below commands

thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   29m

thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.


2.  Create yaml  file with all the parameters , you can copy form gitlab
    https://gitlab.com/nb-tech-support/devops.git

thor@jump_host ~$ vi /tmp/countdown.yaml
thor@jump_host ~$ cat /tmp/countdown.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: countdown-devops
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: countdown-devops
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: container-countdown-devops
          image: debian:latest
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 5" ]
          args:
      restartPolicy: Never


3.  Run below command to create pod

thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl create -f /tmp/countdown.yaml
job.batch/countdown-devops created


4.  Wait for  pods to get running status

thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
countdown-devops-jbpvl   0/1     Completed   0          50s


5.  Click on Finish & Confirm to complete the task successful
