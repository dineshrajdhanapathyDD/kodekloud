Questions:
The Nautilus DevOps team has some conditional data present on (App Server 3) in (Stratos Datacenter). There is a container (ubuntu_latest) running on the same server. We received a request to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container. Below are more details about the task:

On (App Server 3) in (Stratos Datacenter) copy an encrypted file (/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg) from docker host to (ubuntu_latest) container (running on same server) in (/usr/src/) location. Please do not try to modify this file in any way.


Solution:  

1. At first login on app server  as per the task & Switch to  root user 
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
banner@stapp03's password: BigGr33n

[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for banner: BigGr33n


2. Run Below command to check existing docker container running 
[root@stapp03 ~]# docker ps

3. Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg on docker container ubuntu_latest
[root@stapp03 ~]# docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src
