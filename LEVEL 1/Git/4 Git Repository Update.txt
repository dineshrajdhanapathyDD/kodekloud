Questions:
The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories (/opt/cluster.git) was created recently. The team has given us a sample (index.html) file that is currently present on (jump host) under (/tmp) directory. The repository has been cloned at (/usr/src/kodekloudrepos) on (storage server) in (Stratos DC).

Copy sample (index.html) file from (jump host) to (storage server) under cloned repository at (/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster), further (add/commit) the file and push to the (master) branch.


Solution:   

1.  At 1st SCP index.html file from jump server to the storage server    

thor@jump_host ~$  sudo scp /tmp/index.html  natasha@ststor01:/tmp

[sudo] password for thor: mjolnir123
natasha@ststor01's password:  Bl@kW
index.html                                                             100%   27    83.1KB/s   00:00 


2. Login on storage server  & Switch Root user
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
natasha@ststor01's password: Bl@kW

[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for natasha: Bl@kW


 3. Go to project repositories as per the task  

[root@ststor01 ~]# cd   /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/

[root@ststor01 cluster]# ls
info.txt  welcome.txt


4. Copy html file from tmp to repo 

[root@ststor01 cluster]# cp /tmp/index.html  .
[root@ststor01 cluster]# ls
index.html  info.txt  welcome.txt


5.  Add and commit the index.html file

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git add index.html
[root@ststor01 cluster]# git commit -m "add index.html"
[master 7721f79] add index.html
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html


6. Finally push master branch to the origin.

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git push -u origin master
