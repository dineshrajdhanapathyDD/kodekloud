Questions:
The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to setup some CI/CD pipelines. After several meetings they have decided to use Jenkins server. So, we need to setup a (Jenkins Server) as soon as possible. Please complete the task as per requirements mentioned below:

1. Install (jenkins) on jenkins server using (yum) utility only, and start its (service). You might face timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, please refer this link for help.

2. Jenkin's admin user name should be (theadmin), password should be (Adm!n321), full name should be (Yousuf) and email should be (yousuf@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com).

Note:

1. For this task ssh into (jenkins) server using user (root) and password (S3curePass) from (jump host).

2. To complete the (jenkins installation) after installing packages and after starting the jenkins service, click on the (Jenkins) button on the top bar.


Solution:  

1. Login on the jenkins server as a root 
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh root@jenkins
root@jenkins's password: S3curePass

[root@jenkins ~]# sudo yum -y install wget

[root@jenkins ~]# sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
