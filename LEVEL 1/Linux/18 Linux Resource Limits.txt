On our (Storage) server in (Stratos Datacenter) we are having some issues where (nfsuser) user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:

a. soft limit = (1025)

b. hard_limit = (2027)

Solution:  
1. At first login to one storage server  &  Switch to the root user 

thor@jump_host /$ ssh natasha@ststor01
natasha@ststor01's password:  Bl@kW

[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for natasha:  Bl@kW


2.  Edit limit.conf file as below vi /etc/security/limits.conf
vi /etc/security/limits.conf

open new terminal -paste below code:
nfsuser         soft    nproc   1025
nfsuser         hard    nproc   2027
:wq

[root@ststor01 ~]# cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
nfsuser         soft    nproc   1025
nfsuser         hard    nproc   2027
