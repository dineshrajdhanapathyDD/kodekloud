The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in (Stratos DC). Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:

a. (Jump host) is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through (thor) user from (jump host).

b. There is an inventory file (/home/thor/ansible/inventory) on (jump host). Using that inventory file test (Ansible ping) from (jump host) to (App Server 1), make sure ping works.


Solution : 
1.  check the ansible inventory file on jump server host

thor@jump_host ~$ cd /home/thor/ansible/
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ls
inventory

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ vi inventory
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ cat inventory
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n



2. Generate a SSH key on Jump Host . Please note it should Thor user 

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:uptyjMfHhzCN2adVctyTptEZ8/oIRR0w6HeGDgjV5hM thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|        ... .o.o.|
|       .   E  = .|
|        . =..+.* |
|         ..==oOo.|
|       =S  +==oo |
|      =.o o o..  |
|     +.+ =   . o |
|    o =o= .   . .|
|     ++o .       |
+----[SHA256]-----+


3. Copy SSH key to setup password-less authentication to the host

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ssh-copy-id  tony@stapp01
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
tony@stapp01's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'tony@stapp01'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.


thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ssh tony@stapp01
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ whoami
tony
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to stapp01 closed.


4.  Validate the task by below command 







error found:
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible stapp01 -m ping -i inventory -v
Using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as config file
stapp01 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Invalid/incorrect password: Permission denied, please try again.",
    "unreachable": true
