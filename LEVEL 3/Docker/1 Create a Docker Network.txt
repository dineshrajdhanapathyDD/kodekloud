The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:


a. Create a docker network named as (blog) on App Server (3) in (Stratos DC).

b. Configure it to use (bridge) drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet (172.168.0.0/24) and iprange (172.168.0.3/24).



Solution:   

1. Login on app server  as per the task  &  Switch to  root user

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
The authenticity of host 'stapp03 (172.16.238.12)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:bzPKzq4tRnlw6xleOwJ0M2Ox6yW9oAhw4eKWP0jUFN4.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'stapp03,172.16.238.12' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

2. Check existing network on server

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
06eb8353433a        bridge              bridge              local
2facff946852        host                host                local
daf4ba5e867d        none                null                local


3. Create a docker network as per the task use network name subnet  & IPrange

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker network create -d bridge --subnet=172.168.0.0/24 --ip-range=172.168.0.3/24 blog
1bbc29ceea3c5312faac954552a4098808ef700193dbb03213b43fb7818b1b7b


4. Validate the task network has been created successfully 

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
1bbc29ceea3c        blog                bridge              local
06eb8353433a        bridge              bridge              local
2facff946852        host                host                local
daf4ba5e867d        none                null                local


[root@stapp03 ~]# docker network inspect blog

    {
        "Name": "blog",
        "Id": "1bbc29ceea3c5312faac954552a4098808ef700193dbb03213b43fb7818b1b7b",

            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.168.0.0/24",
                    "IPRange": "172.168.0.3/24"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },

    }
]
