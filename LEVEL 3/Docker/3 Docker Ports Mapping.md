## Questions:

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on `Application Server 3` in `Stratos Datacenter`. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:


a. Pull `nginx:alpine-perl` docker image on `Application Server 3`.


b. Create a container named `news` using the image you pulled.


c. Map host port `3002` to container port `80`. Please keep the container in running state.


## Solution:  


**1. At first login on app server  ssh banner@stapp03**

```

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
The authenticity of host 'stapp03 (172.16.238.12)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:aiKm4mbfc9oUI9AUjvyk3cM+60x7IRy+fI4EZWLYy4M.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'stapp03,172.16.238.12' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
banner@stapp03's password: BigGr33n
[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su -

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for banner: BigGr33n
```

**2. Run Below command to check existing docker images** 

```

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```

**3.  Pull Docker image  on server** 

```

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker pull nginx:alpine-perl
alpine-perl: Pulling from library/nginx

Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:alpine-perl
docker.io/library/nginx:alpine-perl
```

**4. Verify the pull image**

```

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
nginx               alpine-perl         da842610a485        4 weeks ago         78MB
```

**5. Run below command to run container**

```

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker container run -d --name news -p 3002:80 nginx:alpine-perl
38c4574aaca8dcd85949a0715aa3d50cc62ac9ea955f181c6a15f08896e33b20
```

**6. Validate the task by below command and curl** 

```

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
