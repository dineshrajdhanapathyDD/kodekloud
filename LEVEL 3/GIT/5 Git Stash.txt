The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository (/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official) present on (Storage server) in (Stratos DC). One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:



Look for the stashed changes under (/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official) git repository, and restore the stash with (stash@{1}) identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.


Solution:  
1. At first login on to the storage server  & switch to the root user

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
The authenticity of host 'ststor01 (172.16.238.15)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:624Sts025xVkhIVZs1pPofeeprbadu4CT1Z1yn9dz0c.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'ststor01,172.16.238.15' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
natasha@ststor01's password: Bl@kW
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for natasha: Bl@kW


2. Check repo on cd 

[root@ststor01 ~]# cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official


3.  Restore the stash with (stash@{1}) identifier

[root@ststor01 official]# git stash apply stash@{1}
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   welcome.txt


4. Commit the files with message

[root@ststor01 official]# git commit -m "commit"
[master f4e9308] commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 welcome.txt


5. Git push to the branch as well master 

[root@ststor01 official]# git push -u origin master
