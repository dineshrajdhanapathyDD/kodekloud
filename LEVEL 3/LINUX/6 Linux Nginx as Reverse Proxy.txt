Questions:

(Nautilus) system admin's team is planning to deploy a front end application for their backup utility on (Nautilus Backup Server), so that they can manage the backups of different websites from a graphical user interface. They have shared requirements to set up the same; please accomplish the tasks as per detail given below:



a. Install (Apache) Server on (Nautilus Backup Server) and configure it to use (3001) port (do not bind it to 127.0.0.1 only, keep it default i.e let Apache listen on server's IP, hostname, localhost, (127.0.0.1) etc).


b. Install (Nginx) webserver on (Nautilus Backup Server) and configure it to use (8093).


c. Configure (Nginx) as a reverse proxy server for (Apache).


d. There is a sample index file (/home/thor/index.html) on (Jump Host), copy that file to (Apache's) document root.


e. Make sure to start (Apache) and (Nginx) services.


f. You can test final changes using (curl) command, e.g (curl http://<backup server IP or Hostname>:8093).


Solution:  
1. At first copy sample index file from jump server to backup server

thor@jump_host ~$ scp /home/thor/index.html clint@stbkp01:/tmp/
clint@stbkp01's password: H@wk3y3


2. Login on Backup server  ssh clint@stbkp01

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh clint@stbkp01
clint@stbkp01's password: H@wk3y3


3. Switch to  root user : sudo su -

[clint@stbkp01 ~]$ sudo su -

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for clint: H@wk3y3
[root@stbkp01 ~]# 


4. Install the packages Apache & Nginx. 

[root@stbkp01 ~]# rpm -qa |grep httpd
[root@stbkp01 ~]# rpm -qa |grep nginx
[root@stbkp01 ~]# yum install httpd

Installed Complete!


5. Edit the httpd.conf & change the Listen port from 80 to 3001

[root@stbkp01 ~]# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Add the vi editor -> Listen 3001

[root@stbkp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep 3001
Listen 3001


6. Install the packages Nginx. 

[root@stbkp01 ~]# yum install nginx

[root@stbkp01 ~]# yum install epel-release

Installed Complete!


7. Copy the index.html file from /tmp to /var/www/html/

[root@stbkp01 ~]# cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/
[root@stbkp01 ~]# ls /var/www/html
index.html


8. Edit the nginx.conf & change the Listen port from 80 to 8093

[root@stbkp01 ~]# vi /etc/nginx/conf/

  server {
        listen       8093 default_server;
        listen       [::]:8093 default_server;
        server_name  172.16.238.16;
        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        location / {
        proxy_pass http://172.16.238.16:3001;
        }


9. Run the command nginx to know the status

root@stbkp01 ~]# nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful


10. Start the httpd and nginx services 

[root@stbkp01 ~]# systemctl start httpd
[root@stbkp01 ~]# systemctl start nginx
[root@stbkp01 ~]# systemctl status nginx
