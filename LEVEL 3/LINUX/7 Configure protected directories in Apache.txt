Questions:

(xFusionCorp Industries) has hosted several static websites on (Nautilus Application Servers) in (Stratos DC). There are some confidential directories in the document root that need to be password protected. Since they are using (Apache) for hosting the websites, the production support team has decided to use (.htaccess) with basic (auth). There is a website that needs to be uploaded to (/var/www/html/sysops) on (Nautilus App Server 2). However, we need to set up the authentication before that.

1. Create (/var/www/html/sysops) direcotry if doesn't exist.

2. Add a user (anita) in (htpasswd) and set its password to (TmPcZjtRQx).

3. There is a file (/tmp/index.html) present on (Jump Server). Copy the same to the directory you created, please make sure default document root should remain (/var/www/html). Also website should work on URL (http://<app-server-hostname>:8080/sysops/)

Solution:  
1. At first  copy the index file from jump server to app server

thor@jump_host ~$ scp /tmp/index.html steve@stapp02:/tmp
The authenticity of host 'stapp02 (172.16.238.11)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:l3iszU5lklfCuq1I+oG+ifVbW4d229eRlhyuomWnzJQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'stapp02,172.16.238.11' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
steve@stapp02's password: 
index.html 


2.  Login on app server  ssh steve@stapp02

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh steve@stapp02
steve@stapp02's password: Am3ric@


3. Switch to  root user : sudo su -

[steve@stapp02 ~]$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for steve: Am3ric@
[root@stapp02 ~]# 


4. Run Below command to check the existing Apache httpd service status 

[root@stapp02 ~]# systemctl status httpd
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
     Docs: man:httpd.service(8)

Sep 21 07:24:22 stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com systemd[1]: httpd.service: Collecting.


5. Create/var/www/html/sysops directory 

[root@stapp02 ~]# mkdir /var/www/html/sysops


6. Add a user and set password as per given in your task 

[root@stapp02 ~]# htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd  anita
New password: TmPcZjtRQx
Re-type new password: TmPcZjtRQx
Adding password for user anita


7. create .htaccess file under dba directory

[root@stapp02 ~]# vi  /var/www/html/sysops/.htaccess
[root@stapp02 ~]# cat /var/www/html/sysops/.htaccess
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Password Required"
Require valid-user
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd


8. Move the copied index.html file under dba directory 

[root@stapp02 ~]# mv /tmp/index.html  /var/www/html/sysops/


9. Post saved config file , start  & check the httpd services status

[root@stapp02 ~]# systemctl start httpd && systemctl status httpd
● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2023-09-21 07:34:02 UTC; 100ms ago
     Docs: man:httpd.service(8)
 Main PID: 1089 (httpd)
   Status: "Started, listening on: port 8080"
    Tasks: 213 (limit: 1340692)


10.  Validate Apache httpd running  as per the task request user and password

[root@stapp02 ~]#  curl -u anita http://stapp02:8080/sysops
Enter host password for user 'anita':
