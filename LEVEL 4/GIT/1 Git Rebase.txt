Questions:

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository (/opt/apps.git). This repo is cloned at (/usr/src/kodekloudrepos) on (storage server) in (Stratos DC). They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:


One of the developers is working on (feature) branch and their work is still in progress, however there are some changes which have been pushed into the (master) branch, the developer now wants to (rebase) the (feature) branch with the (master) branch without loosing any data from the (feature) branch, also they don't want to add any (merge commit) by simply merging the (master) branch into the (feature) branch. Accomplish this task as per requirements mentioned.

Also remember to push your changes once done.


Solution:  
1. At first login on to the storage server  & switch to the root user

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01
The authenticity of host 'ststor01 (172.16.238.15)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:4qpVu6YA9q0V+ODkZ6Pp9oE1dpU/8qYDAoPYAKSjL7E.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'ststor01,172.16.238.15' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
natasha@ststor01's password: Bl@kW

[natasha@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]$ sudo su -

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

2. check repo and go to kodekloudrepos directory: cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

[root@ststor01 ~]# cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# ls
apps

[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# cd apps
[root@ststor01 apps]# ls
feature.txt  info.txt


3. Rebase from master branch: git rebase master feature

[root@ststor01 apps]# git rebase master feature

4. Set git rebase: git config --global pull.rebase true

[root@ststor01 apps]# git config --global pull.rebase true


5. Pull from origin feature branch: git pull origin feature

[root@ststor01 apps]# git pull origin feature
